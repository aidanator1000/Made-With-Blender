This was a fun one. Using grids and css, I was able to hone in on making things clear, readable and functional. In fact, I previously made the same website, same type of format, but it didn't work. Like at all. 

Before I knew how easy css files were, before I basically knew they were a thing, I wrote each style on each individual tag. Before I knew padding and margin, I'd just try and eyeball the positioning as best as I could with fixed position. It was even more difficult because I tried to force gradients into there, and I only knew px so scaling just didn't work. I tried separating stuff with <br>, I just copy and pasted everything while trying to align everything manually. You can tell that the coding was atrocious.

This assignment was different, and everything worked perfectly thanks to primarily one thing and one thing only: THE GRID

Admittedly, I never fully understood most things in class, especially grid or flexbox. I didn't understand the application, where it could be used, or how setting it up actually worked, like the template thingy. I then took a long time to research and find out how to do everything (at least for grids) and OH MY GOD WHERE HAS THIS BEEN ALL MY LIFE. Things scale when you squish the webpage, stuff is positioned on the page without tons of code, it all felt so streamlined and linear and it was fantastic. I even figured out how to use some stuff I found online to give it a nice polish, like the animate on scroll thingy! 

This was honestly a lot of fun getting to try stuff out and figure out my available tools and the common workflow. I still feel like I am a beginner, so I am really excited to learn more, and hopefully understand it this time! I didn't have much interest in making a website until this course, so that's cool!

One thing I am really proud of is the introduction video that plays when you load the page. I think that thing looks fantastic, it took a bit of work to match the background (Colours can be weird when you do compositing, so it really was an eyeball thing) but it works, looks insanely cool, and I couldn't be happier with it! I had that logo made previously for grade 11 film class, and I haven't used it since. I thought it would be really nice to show off my work with this project, really make it about something I am interested in! I hope you enjoy, and honestly, consider blender if you want something fun to do. It is open source sooooooooyoucandosomecodinginitwinkwinknudgenudge
